				UnicodeQuickFix
		 makes the python interpreter think in unicode
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you getting the dreaded "'ascii' codec can't encode character" error when
using non-ASCII characters in Plone?  Do you want it go Just Go Away Right
Now(tm), and don't care if the quick fix may (but is not by any means assured
to) cause you headaches down the road?  This product is for you!

UnicodeQuickFix tells the python interpreter to use Unicode.  It solves ascii
codec error in all cases we've tested it with so far.  People say this is a
bad/ugly way to fix Plone's Unicode issues, but haven't really explained why.
Your mileage may vary.
